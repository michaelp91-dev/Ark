Ark - Flight Controller

The program is flight controller for model rockets.
As of today, October 8 2024, it is in the development phase.
The hardware necessary for this is as follows:
2x Raspberry Pi Picos
2x RFM95 modules
1x MPU6050 sensor
1x BME280 sensor

The goal for this program is serve two purposes during a rockets flight:
1) Data logging 
2) Flight stability

As of today, Data Logging is in development. Flight Stability has not enter development phase.

To Do List:
1) Write code for trimming/setting MPU6050
2) Send MPU6050 data through Ark RFM95 module to Base Pico RFM95 module
3) Visualize data received through Base Pico RFM95 module on Base Computer

More to come.
